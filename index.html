    <p class="centered">"I write this to remind you that being alone is okay,
    it doesn't mean that you're not part of any kind of<br>
    certain group of people or being left behind. Rather, that
    is the time for you to have your own personal<br> space and
    give enough time to recharge yourself from the unnecessary
    noises that make you drained. An <br> opportunity to acquire
    inner peace and self-realization from the things that you
    have made this far. Note <br> that you don’t have to suit into the
    perspective and standards of others". -je
    Hope this helps you ❤..</p>
